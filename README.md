# 🎯 ListyAI

> **AI-powered list management** - Because your brain has better things to remember.

## What This Does

ListyAI is an intelligent list management app that uses AI to make creating and organizing lists actually useful. Instead of another basic to-do app, ListyAI understands context and helps you build better lists faster.

**Current Status:** 🚧 Active Development - Shipping features as they're ready

## Why I Built This

As a Growth Leader, I know the best product insights come from **building, not just strategizing**. 

ListyAI is my laboratory for:
- Understanding how AI transforms everyday productivity tools
- Rapid prototyping - validating ideas through execution, not decks
- Staying sharp on modern development patterns
- Solving my own problem first (the best product validation)

## The Approach

**Built with AI assistance** - Using Claude + Cursor because modern builders leverage the best tools available. This is "vibe-coding" in action: fast iteration, learning by shipping, and focusing on solving real problems over perfect code.

## What's Coming

This is a working prototype - emphasis on both "working" and "prototype." The code isn't perfect, but it solves a real problem. That's the startup way.

**Roadmap:**
- 🔄 Core list creation and management
- 🔄 AI-powered smart suggestions
- 🔄 Intelligent categorization
- 🔄 Context-aware organization

## Building Philosophy

**Ship fast. Learn faster. Iterate relentlessly.**

This project embodies how I approach growth: execute quickly, validate with real usage, double down on what works. Same principles whether building a product or a growth engine.
